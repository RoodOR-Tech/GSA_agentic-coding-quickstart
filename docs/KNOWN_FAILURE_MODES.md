# Known Failure Modes

This document captures real-world failure patterns when using Docker SBX + USAi + agent frameworks. If you're hitting something weird, it's probably in here.

---

## 1. "Unknown Agent" Error on sbx create

### Symptoms

- `sbx create my-sandbox` fails
- Error: `unknown agent "my-sandbox"`

### Root Cause

SBX `create` command requires an agent type (e.g., `opencode`, `claude`, `shell`) and a workspace path.

### Fix

Use the correct syntax:
```bash
# Correct: specify agent type and path
sbx create opencode .

# With custom name
sbx create --name my-sandbox opencode .
```

Available agents: `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, `docker-agent`, `gemini`, `kiro`, `opencode`, `shell`

---

## 2. API Key Works in UI but Fails in Agent

### Symptoms

- Works in Swagger / web UI
- Fails in agent or CLI
- Error: `authentication failed` or `401 Unauthorized`

### Likely Causes

- Incorrect header format
- Missing `Bearer` prefix
- Wrong environment variable injection

### Fix

Ensure header format is correct:
```
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
```

Confirm the injected env var is present inside the sandbox:
```bash
acq exec <sandbox> -- sh -c 'echo $USAI_API_KEY'
```

---

## 3. Agent Cannot See API Key / USAi Authentication Fails

### Symptoms

- Agent fails silently or errors on auth
- OpenCode shows generic providers instead of USAi
- `{"detail":"Authentication failed"}` from USAi API

### Root Cause

SBX's secret proxy only works with **standard provider endpoints**. USAi uses a custom `baseURL` (`https://api.gsa.usai.gov/api/v1`), which the proxy doesn't recognize.

When you use `sbx secret set -g openai`, SBX:
1. Stores your key
2. Sets `OPENAI_API_KEY=proxy-managed` in the container
3. Intercepts requests to `api.openai.com` and injects the real key

But requests to `api.gsa.usai.gov` bypass this proxy entirely.

### Fix

Store the key as a custom secret so sbx injects it for you:

```bash
sbx secret set-custom -g --host api.gsa.usai.gov --env USAI_API_KEY
```

Recreate the sandbox so the secret takes effect. `opencode.jsonc` reads the
injected value via `{env:USAI_API_KEY}`.

---

## 4. Secrets Accidentally Printed

### Symptoms

- API key appears in logs/output
- Key visible in terminal history

### Root Cause

- Debugging via `printenv` or `env`
- Logging config objects that contain credentials
- Shell history capturing secret values

### Fix

- Never print full environment
- Mask values if debugging required
- Use `set +o history` before working with secrets
- Review agent logs before sharing

---

## 5. Incorrect baseURL

### Symptoms

- Model list fails
- 404 or unexpected API errors
- Connection refused

### Root Cause

Wrong endpoint format in configuration.

### Fix

Use the correct format:
```
https://api.gsa.usai.gov/api/v1
```

NOT:
- Missing `/api/v1` suffix
- Swagger UI URL
- Documentation endpoint
- Trailing slash issues

---

## 6. SBX CLI Behavior Changes

### Symptoms

- Commands stop working between runs
- Flags behave differently than expected
- Documentation doesn't match actual behavior

### Root Cause

SBX tooling is rapidly evolving with frequent breaking changes.

### Fix

- Check `sbx --help` for current syntax
- Check `sbx <command> --help` for subcommand options
- Revalidate commands before assuming code failure
- Avoid scripting around unstable flags
- Pin to specific SBX versions if possible

---

## 7. Agent Tries to Escape Sandbox

### Symptoms

- Attempts to access host filesystem paths
- Unexpected file path errors
- Permission denied on paths that "should" exist

### Root Cause

Agent assumes host filesystem layout, not container layout.

### Fix

- Enforce working directory constraints in AGENTS.md
- Avoid granting unnecessary volume mounts
- Configure agent with container-relative paths
- Review agent file access patterns

---

## 8. Model Appears Available but Fails at Runtime

### Symptoms

- `/models` endpoint lists the model
- Inference requests fail with errors
- "Model not found" despite being listed

### Root Cause

- Model not actually enabled for your API key
- Backend routing mismatch
- Model requires specific parameters not provided

### Fix

- Test with minimal request first
- Confirm model entitlement with USAi provider
- Check if model requires specific `max_tokens` or other params
- Try a different model to isolate the issue

---

## 9. Long Timeouts / Hanging Requests

### Symptoms

- Requests never return
- Agent appears stuck
- Eventually fails with timeout

### Root Cause

- Missing timeout configuration
- Network routing issues inside container
- DNS resolution failures
- Proxy misconfiguration

### Fix

Set explicit timeouts in config:
```json
{
  "requestTimeout": 30000,
  "chunkTimeout": 5000
}
```

Check network connectivity from inside container:
```bash
acq exec <sandbox> -- curl -I https://api.gsa.usai.gov/api/v1/models
```

---

## 10. Overcomplicated Setup

### Symptoms

- Too many scripts to run
- Hard to reproduce environment
- Works on one machine, fails on another
- Debugging requires tribal knowledge

### Root Cause

Over-engineering instead of testing. Adding layers when simplicity would work.

### Fix

- Delete unnecessary wrapper scripts
- Prefer 1 config file + 1 command
- Document the minimal reproduction steps
- If setup takes more than 3 commands, simplify

---

## 11. False Sense of Security

### Symptoms

- Assuming "it's in a container so it's safe"
- Relaxing secret handling because of SBX
- Not reviewing agent outputs

### Reality

Containers are NOT perfect isolation:
- Container escapes exist
- Mounted volumes expose host data
- Network access can leak information
- Logs may be captured outside container

### Fix

- Treat SBX as a strong boundary, not absolute
- Continue to avoid exposing secrets at all costs
- Review agent outputs before sharing
- Don't mount sensitive host directories
- Apply defense in depth

---

## 12. Environment Variable Naming Conflicts

### Symptoms

- Agent uses wrong API key
- Configuration seems ignored
- Unexpected behavior with correct config

### Root Cause

Multiple tools expecting different env var names:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `USAI_API_KEY`
- `API_KEY`
- Tool-specific variations

### Fix

- Check tool documentation for expected variable names
- Set all expected variations if needed
- Use explicit config file settings over env vars when possible

---

## 13. Config File Not Found in Container

### Symptoms

- Agent starts with defaults
- Custom configuration ignored
- "Config file not found" warnings

### Root Cause

Config file exists on host but not mounted into container.

### Fix

Ensure config is in the mounted working directory. When using `acq run` (or
`acq create`), the current directory is automatically mounted:

```bash
# Run from the directory containing your config
cd /path/to/project-with-config
acq run opencode .
```

Or copy config into an existing container:

```bash
acq cp ./opencode.jsonc my-sandbox:/workspace/
```

---

## 14. SBX Built-in Proxy Doesn't Auto-Cover USAi's Custom baseURL (Use `set-custom`)

### Symptoms

- `sbx secret set -g openai` succeeds
- But USAi authentication still fails
- `OPENAI_API_KEY=proxy-managed` in container
- Must inject the key via a custom secret instead

### Root Cause

SBX's **default** provider proxy intercepts requests to a fixed set of **known
provider endpoints** (like `api.openai.com`) and injects credentials there. A
custom `baseURL` endpoint like USAi (`api.gsa.usai.gov`) is not one of those
built-in services, so `sbx secret set -g openai` never applies to it — you must
register USAi as a **custom secret** (`sbx secret set-custom`) instead. `acq`
does exactly this for you (`acq secret set usai`, routed through the
`secret set-custom` branch of `acq.backends/sbx.sh`).

### Security Implication

**Under the sanctioned `acq` setup, the agent does NOT hold the raw USAi key.**
`set-custom` is proxied the same way the built-in services are — it just has to
be configured explicitly because USAi is not a built-in endpoint.

Concretely, `sbx secret set-custom` bakes a **placeholder token** into the
sandbox's `USAI_API_KEY` at creation time, and the sbx proxy resolves that
placeholder to the real secret value **at request time**, on the wire to
`api.gsa.usai.gov`. So:

- Agent sees: `USAI_API_KEY=<placeholder>` (not the real key value)
- The real credential lives in the sbx secret store on the host, never in the
  container environment
- The agent process cannot read the raw key from its own environment

This matches the built-in proxy posture (and the MSB `--secret ENV@HOST`
swap-on-the-wire model), and it is what `AGENTS.md` states: secrets are
**injected placeholders or proxied — the agent never holds the real USAi key
material**. (The placeholder mechanism is described in more detail in
[Section 23](#23-usai-401-in-an-existing-sandbox-after-deletingrecreating-the-global-secret).)

### Narrow caveat: non-default paths that DO expose the value

The raw value only reaches the container if you deliberately bypass the
sanctioned flow:

- Passing `sbx secret set-custom … --value <the-secret>` on the command line
  puts the value in argv (and shell history). `acq` never does this — it prompts
  interactively or stores the value in the acq store and prints the manual
  command as a last resort; it does not echo the value on argv.
- A hand-rolled setup that exports the raw key into the container env (e.g.
  `export USAI_API_KEY=<real-key>` in a profile, or `--value` in a script)
  defeats the placeholder mechanism.

These are non-default, unsupported configurations. Under `acq run` the agent
sees a placeholder, not the key.

### Mitigations

1. **Placeholder injection** - the agent's env holds a placeholder, not the key
2. **AGENTS.md rules** prohibit printing/logging secrets
3. **Container isolation** limits exposure scope
4. **No persistence** - key never written to disk in the sandbox

### Fix

Register USAi as a custom secret so sbx injects the placeholder (prefer `acq`,
which does this for you):

```bash
# Preferred: acq configures the custom secret for both backends
acq secret set usai

# Equivalent raw sbx command (interactive prompt for the value — no --value):
sbx secret set-custom --host api.gsa.usai.gov --env USAI_API_KEY
```

Your `opencode.jsonc` should use variable substitution:
```json
{
  "provider": {
    "usai": {
      "options": {
        "apiKey": "{env:USAI_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Upstream Tracking

A convenience request to let the proxy inject credentials for custom endpoints
without an explicit `set-custom` step is tracked in
**[docker/sbx-releases#35](https://github.com/docker/sbx-releases/issues/35)** -
"Feature Request: Configurable Secret Injection for Custom Services". Note this
is an ergonomics improvement (auto-mapping custom services), **not** a security
gap: `set-custom` already proxies the credential today, so the agent does not see
the raw key under the current setup.

---

## 15. Direct Credential Injection for Git Providers (Security Consideration)

### Context

GitHub is a built-in SBX service (`sbx secret set -g github`), but GitLab is not. This means:
- **GitHub**: Uses the proxy (recommended)
- **GitLab**: Must use a custom secret (`sbx secret set-custom -g --host <host> --env GITLAB_TOKEN`)

### Security Assessment for MVP

| Concern | Severity | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Token visible in container env | Low | Container is isolated, short-lived |
| Token in shell history | Low | sbx prompts for the value; never typed on the command line |
| Token in process list | Low | Stored secret injected by sbx, not passed via process args |
| Agent could exfiltrate token | Medium | Agent already has network access; proxy doesn't prevent this |
| Token logged by agent | Medium | AGENTS.md prohibits; pre-commit hooks catch committed secrets |

### Key Insight

**The SBX proxy doesn't prevent a malicious agent from exfiltrating credentials** - it prevents the agent from *seeing* them directly. A compromised agent could still make authenticated API calls and exfiltrate data through those APIs.

The real security boundary is:
1. **Sandbox isolation** - container can't escape to host
2. **Trusted agent software** - OpenCode, Claude Code, etc. are vetted
3. **Scoped tokens** - use minimal scopes (e.g., `repo`, not admin)
4. **Short-lived sessions** - tokens only in memory during execution

### Acceptable for MVP Because

1. **Local development environment** with low-impact data (no PII, no CUI)
2. **Tokens are scoped** - not admin/owner tokens
3. **Sandbox provides isolation** from host system
4. **Direct injection is a documented SBX pattern** - shown in their own docs
5. **Upstream tracking exists** - this is a known gap, not a workaround hack

### Recommendations

1. **Use SBX proxy when available** - GitHub supports it, use `sbx secret set -g github`
2. **Scope tokens minimally** - only grant permissions the agent actually needs
3. **Rotate tokens periodically** - treat injected tokens as potentially exposed
4. **Review agent outputs** - before sharing logs, ensure no tokens leaked
5. **Monitor API usage** - watch for unexpected patterns

If GitHub auth in an existing sandbox starts failing after token rotation,
force-refresh the stored global GitHub secret from the host:

```bash
gh auth token | sbx secret set -g github --force
```

### Upstream Tracking

- **SBX custom service support**: [docker/sbx-releases#35](https://github.com/docker/sbx-releases/issues/35)
- **Helper script exploration**: [GSA-TTS/agentic-coding-quickstart#15](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/agentic-coding-quickstart/issues/15)

## 16. SSL/TLS Certificate Error: "unable to get local issuer certificate"

### Symptoms

- OpenCode crashes or fails to connect to USAi
- Error: `unable to get local issuer certificate`
- Occurs on GFE (Government Furnished Equipment) networks

### Root Cause

On federal/GFE networks, secure internet traffic is often intercepted and decrypted using a custom Root Certificate Authority (CA) for security inspection.

Because the sandboxed container runs a vanilla Linux environment, it does not automatically trust your host's GFE custom root certificate. When Node.js tries to establish a TLS connection to `https://api.gsa.usai.gov/api/v1`, it rejects the connection because it cannot verify the custom certificate chain.

### Fix

To resolve this during local development, you can tell Node.js to ignore TLS validation errors inside the sandbox using `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`.

> **⚠️ SECURITY WARNING:** Disabling TLS validation bypasses certificate verification, which is a significant security risk. This workaround should **only** be used:
> - For debugging TLS issues in isolated local development environments
> - **Never** with real credentials or production endpoints
> - **Never** in CI/CD pipelines or shared environments

#### Workaround: Pass Environment Variable via SBX

The `sbx run` command does **not** support the `-e` flag for environment variables. Use the two-step `create` + `exec` pattern instead:

```bash
# For debugging TLS issues only - never use with real credentials

# Step 1: Create the sandbox (or skip if it already exists)
sbx create --name debug-sandbox opencode .

# Step 2: Run with environment variable
sbx exec -e NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 debug-sandbox opencode
```

Alternatively, combine into a single line:

```bash
sbx create --name debug-sandbox opencode . 2>/dev/null || true && \
sbx exec -e NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 debug-sandbox opencode
```

**Important:** Only `sbx exec` supports the `-e` flag, not `sbx run`.

---

## 17. Chose "Open" Network Policy by Mistake

### Symptoms

- Selected "Open" network policy during first sbx run
- Security concern: Open policy allows access to internal GSA resources

### Root Cause

"Open" policy allows all network traffic without restrictions, which is a security risk on GFE (Government Furnished Equipment) machines.

### Fix

Reset and reconfigure:
```bash
# Reset policy (will prompt for new choice)
sbx policy reset

# Choose "Balanced" when prompted, then add USAi
sbx policy allow network "api.gsa.usai.gov"

# Verify
sbx policy ls
```

### Prevention

Always choose "Balanced" (Option 2) when prompted. The Balanced policy allows typical dev traffic while blocking internal network access.

---

## 18. Migrating from `docker sandbox`

### Symptoms

- You're using deprecated `docker sandbox ...` commands
- Want to know the `sbx` CLI equivalents

### Root Cause

The Docker Desktop-integrated `docker sandbox` command is deprecated. The standalone `sbx` CLI replaces it and does not require Docker Desktop.

### Fix

Migrate to the equivalent `sbx` commands:

| Deprecated Command | New Command |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `docker sandbox create --name NAME opencode .` | `sbx create --name NAME opencode .` |
| `docker sandbox run NAME` | `sbx run --name NAME` |
| `docker sandbox exec NAME cmd` | `sbx exec NAME cmd` |
| `docker sandbox ls` | `sbx ls` |
| `docker sandbox rm NAME` | `sbx rm NAME` |

Your existing sandboxes and secrets will continue to work with the `sbx` CLI.

---

## 19. OpenCode Shows Wrong Providers

### Symptoms

- OpenCode lists generic providers instead of USAi
- Custom USAi model catalog missing

### Root Cause

The USAi provider config is not loaded in the sandbox. With `acq`, it is
delivered by the `usai-provider` **kit** (applied by pinned remote reference
from the agentic-coding-patterns repo), which stages an `opencode.jsonc` at
`~/usai-config/` and, at startup, merges it into OpenCode's global config at
`~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc` (the kit no longer sets `OPENCODE_CONFIG`).
`acq` applies it alongside the `agentic-coding-playbook` and
`zscaler-ca-certificate` kits. This symptom appears when the sandbox was created
without `acq` (so the kits were not applied), or with a plain backend `run`
(e.g. `sbx run` / `msb run`) without the kit refs.

**Upgrading an existing sandbox (pre-kit).** A sandbox created before the kit
migration has no USAi provider config and no playbook clone. `acq` attempts to
**heal it in place**: the next time you `acq run` against such a sandbox, it
detects the missing kit(s) and injects them (on sbx via `sbx kit add`). This
worked on sbx 0.35.0–0.37.x, where `sbx kit add` recreated the container with the
augmented kit set while preserving state.

> **sbx 0.38 caveat.** On sbx >= 0.38, `sbx kit add` no longer applies
> startup-bearing kits mid-life (see [Section 35](#35-re-attach-heal-loop-warns-every-time-on-sbx-038--sbx-kit-add-refuses-startup-bearing-kits)),
> and every built-in acq kit declares startup commands. In-place healing of the
> built-in bundle therefore does **not** work on 0.38+: to add or refresh the
> bundle you must recreate the sandbox (`acq rm && acq run`). acq detects the
> refusal and prints that guidance.
>
> **Historical note.** Earlier releases could *not* auto-heal in place: on
> `sbx` ≤ 0.34.x, `sbx kit add` failed (`failed to read tar header: unexpected
> EOF`) on any kit shipping a static file — including the `usai-provider` kit
> ([docker/sbx-releases#133][sbx133]). `sbx` 0.35.0 fixed this, so `acq` requires
> `sbx` >= 0.35.0 on the sbx backend and heals unconditionally.

`acq` waits for the sandbox to be ready for exec before probing (right after a
create or a cold start, exec fails with `inspect exec: context deadline
exceeded` for a few seconds; `acq` polls until a trivial exec succeeds) so a
cold-start delay is not misread as "kit absent".

> **Detecting a pre-kit sandbox.** `acq` decides a kit is missing by checking for
> the kit's footprint (e.g. the USAi config file), classifying on the probe's
> **stdout** (`present`/`absent`), never its exit status — `test -f` exits
> non-zero when the file is absent, which is indistinguishable from a genuine
> exec failure, so an exit-status check would wrongly treat "file absent" as
> "probe failed" and skip healing.

[sbx133]: https://github.com/docker/sbx-releases/issues/133

### Fix

Usually there is nothing to do — re-running `acq run opencode <path>` against
the sandbox heals it in place (state preserved). If a kit injection fails, `acq`
prints the exact manual recovery command. You can also run it yourself; remote
kit sources must be allowlisted first (`acq` does this automatically, but by hand
on the sbx backend it is):

```bash
sbx settings set kit.allowedSources '["docker.io/","github.com/GSA-TTS/"]'
REPO="git+https://github.com/GSA-TTS/agentic-coding-patterns.git"
DIR="integrations/isolation/acq-kits"
sbx kit add SANDBOX "${REPO}#ref=<sha>&dir=${DIR}/usai-provider"
sbx kit add SANDBOX "${REPO}#ref=<sha>&dir=${DIR}/agentic-coding-playbook"
sbx kit add SANDBOX "${REPO}#ref=<sha>&dir=${DIR}/zscaler-ca-certificate"
```

As a last resort, recreate the sandbox from scratch (this discards the sandbox's
session/context):

```bash
sbx rm --force SANDBOX          # discard the sandbox (irreversible)
./acq run opencode /path/to/your/project
```

---

## 20. Authentication Failed After Copying a New Key

### Symptoms

- USAi authentication fails immediately after creating/copying a key
- Key looks correct but is rejected

### Root Cause

The displayed key value in the console may be truncated when selected by hand, so the stored secret is incomplete.

### Fix

Regenerate the key and use the console **copy button** immediately instead of selecting the displayed text. Then confirm the secret is stored:

```bash
sbx secret ls -g | grep USAI_API_KEY
```

If problems persist, see [Section 2](#2-api-key-works-in-ui-but-fails-in-agent) and [Section 3](#3-agent-cannot-see-api-key--usai-authentication-fails). As a last resort, recreate the sandbox (this destroys all sandbox state, including uncommitted work):

```bash
acq rm <sandbox-name>
```

---

## 21. SBX Fails to Start with Host Path `chdir` Error

### Symptoms

- `acq run opencode ...` exits after printing an OCI runtime error
- Error includes: `OCI runtime exec failed: chdir to '/Users/.../your-project': no such file or directory`
- The agent process may exit before opening an interactive session

### Root Cause

SBX cached sandbox metadata can point at a workspace path that no longer exists or is not mounted inside the container. This is most likely after moving, renaming, or reprovisioning a project, or after reusing an old sandbox with a stale workspace path.

### Fix

Find the stale sandbox and recreate it from the current workspace:

```bash
sbx ls
sbx rm <sandbox-name>
./acq run opencode /path/to/your/project
```

For this quickstart clone itself, the default sandbox name is derived as
`<agent>-<clone-folder>` — for `./acq run opencode .` in a clone named
`agentic-coding-quickstart` that is `opencode-agentic-coding-quickstart`:

```bash
sbx rm opencode-agentic-coding-quickstart
./acq run opencode .
```

If you used an explicit sandbox name, remove that same name and rerun with the same `--name` value:

```bash
sbx rm my-project
./acq run --name my-project opencode /path/to/your/project
```

---

## 22. Signed Commits Show "Unverified" on GitHub

### Symptoms

- Commits made inside a sandbox are signed (`git log --show-signature` looks
  fine locally) but GitHub shows an **Unverified** badge, or no badge.
- `acq` printed a note before attaching: *"no repo-local git user.email is set
  for this project."*

### Root Cause

The `git-ssh-sign` kit signs commits, but GitHub only marks an SSH-signed commit
**Verified** when **both** are true:

1. the commit's `user.email` is an email **verified on your GitHub account**, and
2. your **public** signing key is registered on that account **as a Signing
   Key** (Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key → Key type: **Signing
   Key**) — an authentication-only key does not verify commits.

No kit sets `user.email` / `user.name` (identity is user-owned, not something a
signing mixin should inject). Crucially, the sandbox has its **own home
directory**, so your host's **global** `~/.gitconfig` identity is **not visible
inside it** — only the project's **repo-local** identity (stored in the mounted
workspace) reaches the sandbox. A host global `user.email` alone therefore yields
signed-but-Unverified commits.

### Fix

Set the identity **repo-local** (inside the project, so the mount carries it into
the sandbox — a host `--global` value will not):

```bash
git config user.email you@verified-on-github.example
git config user.name  "Your Name"
```

Then register the **public** half of your signing key on GitHub as a **Signing
Key**, and make a **new** commit — verification applies going forward. `acq`
checks the project's **repo-local** `user.email` before attaching (the only tier
the sandbox can see) and warns if it is unset. For signing mechanics and more
failure modes, see the kit's
[`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/agentic-coding-patterns/blob/main/integrations/isolation/acq-kits/git-ssh-sign/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

> plus an in-guest `socat` bridge, see
> [ADR-0021](adr/0021-msb-host-ssh-agent-forwarding-via-vsock.md)), so
> `git-ssh-sign` works on msb at parity with sbx. Verified end-to-end on a
> macOS/HVF host (2026-08-17) via `scripts/verify-backends` (the guest's forwarded
> agent exposes a hermetic throwaway key over the `--vsock` + socat path); re-run
> on the ADR-0011 periodic-validation cadence. The upstream watch-list and
> follow-on `acq`/kit checklist are tracked in
> [`GSA-TTS/agentic-coding-quickstart#303`](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/agentic-coding-quickstart/issues/303).

## 23. USAi 401 in an Existing Sandbox After Deleting/Recreating the Global Secret

### Symptoms

- A **fresh** sandbox authenticates to USAi fine, but an **existing** sandbox
  keeps failing with **HTTP 401** from the models API.
- You recently **deleted the global USAi secret and re-added it** (rather than
  using `acq usai-rotate-api-key`), and/or you had a stray `USAI_API_KEY`
  exported in your shell (`.zshrc`/`.bashrc`) that you commented out.
- `acq run` printed something like:

  ```text
  The global USAi key works in a fresh sandbox, but 'opencode-workspace' still
  fails with HTTP 401. This usually means the existing sandbox has a stale
  USAI_API_KEY placeholder from before rotation.

  Could not read the sandbox's USAI_API_KEY placeholder. Aborting attach.
  ```

- The `usai-provider` config (`opencode.jsonc`) **is** loaded — OpenCode shows
  the USAi provider and correct `baseURL` — so this is **not** the pre-kit
  migration case in [Section 19](#19-opencode-shows-wrong-providers). The config
  is fine; only the injected credential fails to resolve.

### Root Cause

USAi is injected as a **custom secret** (`sbx secret set-custom`), which is
**not** covered by sbx's built-in provider proxy automatically — but it is still
proxied via the placeholder mechanism. sbx bakes a **placeholder token** into
each sandbox's `USAI_API_KEY` at creation time, and the sbx proxy resolves that
placeholder to the real global secret value at request time (so the agent's env
holds the placeholder, not the raw key — see
[Section 14](#14-sbx-built-in-proxy-doesnt-auto-cover-usais-custom-baseurl-use-set-custom)).

When you **delete and re-add** the global secret (as opposed to rotating it in
place), sbx mints a **new placeholder**. A newly created sandbox picks up the new
placeholder, but an **existing** sandbox still carries the **old** placeholder —
which the proxy can no longer resolve. The proxy then injects an **empty**
`USAI_API_KEY`, so USAi returns 401. Reading the sandbox's baked-in value can
even come back **empty**, which is why older versions hit a hard
`Could not read the sandbox's USAI_API_KEY placeholder. Aborting attach.`
dead-end here.

> Contrast with `acq usai-rotate-api-key` (`scripts/rotate-apikey`), which
> **preserves the existing placeholder** across rotation on purpose — so running
> sandboxes keep resolving. Deleting + re-adding the secret defeats that.

### Fix (automatic)

On attach, `acq run` validates the sandbox's USAi key (`check_key`) and, when it
is not `200`, prints the rotate steps and offers to **rotate the key in place**
(`acq usai-rotate-api-key`), then re-validates before attaching. Rotation
preserves the placeholder, so this resolves the common expired-key case:

```bash
./acq run opencode /path/to/your/project
```

> **Note (stale-placeholder recovery).** The deeper two-route recovery for this
> exact 401-after-delete-and-re-add case — session-preserving recreate, or a
> non-destructive sandbox-scoped rebind to the current global placeholder — is
> **not implemented in `acq`** (see [ADR-0008](adr/0008-usai-placeholder-recovery.md)
> for the design). If an in-place rotate does not clear the 401 (because the
> stored *placeholder* — not the key value — is stale), use the manual rebind
> below or recreate the sandbox.

### Fix (manual)

Either recreate the sandbox:

```bash
sbx rm --force <sandbox-name>
./acq run opencode /path/to/your/project
```

…or rebind the existing sandbox to the current global placeholder. First read
the current placeholder from the global secret list, then bind a sandbox-scoped
secret to it (sbx prompts for the key value):

```bash
# The value in the USAI_API_KEY column is the current placeholder:
sbx secret ls -g | grep USAI_API_KEY

sbx secret set-custom <sandbox-name> --host api.gsa.usai.gov \
  --env USAI_API_KEY --placeholder <current-placeholder>
```

> **Do not** bind to the sandbox's *old* placeholder — that is the value that
> stopped resolving. Always bind to the **current global** one.

### Prevention

- Rotate with `acq usai-rotate-api-key`, which preserves the placeholder so
  existing sandboxes keep working. Avoid deleting + re-adding the global secret.
- Remove any `export USAI_API_KEY=...` from your shell profile — the sandbox gets
  its value from sbx injection, and a host env var only causes confusion.

## 24. Pulled/Switched a Branch but acq Still Shows Old Behavior

### Symptoms

- You `git pull` or `git checkout` a branch with a fix, but `acq` still
  prints wording or behaves in a way that only exists in an **older** version.
- `git pull origin <branch>` prints **`Already up to date.`** yet nothing changes.
- You are `cd`'d into a quickstart clone, but the behavior does not match the
  code you see in that clone's `acq`.

### Root Cause

Two independent traps, often combined:

1. **`git pull origin <branch>` does not switch you to that branch.** `pull` =
   `fetch` + `merge FETCH_HEAD` into the branch you are **currently on**.
   `Already up to date` means the *merge* was a no-op — **not** that your working
   tree now contains the branch. If you never ran `git switch <branch>` /
   `git checkout <branch>`, your working tree still has the old `acq`.

2. **An `acq` on your `PATH` points at a *different* clone.** If `acq` is
   invoked by bare name (not `./acq`), the shell resolves it via
   `PATH`. A symlink in `~/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` may point at a **different
   clone** than the one you edited/pulled. `acq` follows that symlink to find
   its own directory, so it runs the *other* clone's code — you update clone A
   and execute clone B.

A related variant: exporting `QUICKSTART_CLONE` overrides where sibling helper
scripts are located, which can also make "which clone is in effect" confusing.

### Fix

First, ask acq which file and clone are actually running:

```bash
acq version
```

It prints the resolved script path, the clone directory, and that clone's git
branch@commit (and flags if the tree is dirty or `QUICKSTART_CLONE` is set).
Compare the branch/commit against what you expect.

Then, depending on which trap you hit:

- **Wrong branch checked out:** switch (don't just pull):

  ```bash
  git switch fix/your-branch      # or: git checkout fix/your-branch
  git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD # confirm
  ```

- **Running a different clone via a PATH symlink:** either run the clone you
  updated directly, or re-point the symlink:

  ```bash
  # Run the clone you actually updated:
  ./acq run opencode <your-project>

  # …or see where the installed one lives and re-point it:
  readlink -f "$(command -v acq)"
  ```

When you run `acq run` from inside one quickstart clone while the executing
`acq` lives in another, acq now prints a startup note pointing this out.

### Prevention

- Use `git switch <branch>` to change branches; treat `Already up to date` as a
  signal to check `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`, not confirmation.
- Keep a single canonical clone, and make any `acq` on `PATH` a symlink to
  that clone's `acq`. Run `acq version` when in doubt.

## 25. `acq run` Prompts for a GitHub Username/Password During Kit Fetch

### Symptoms

Running `acq run …` prints an interactive prompt and then fails:

```
Username for 'https://github.com': you@agency.gov
Password for 'https://you%40agency.gov@github.com':
kit-translate: failed to fetch git+https://github.com/GSA-TTS/agentic-coding-patterns.git#ref=…&dir=…
kit-translate:   remote: Invalid username or token. Password authentication is not supported for Git operations.
```

You may already be authenticated with the `gh` CLI (`gh auth status` is green).

### Root Cause

`gh auth login` authenticates the **`gh` CLI**, not plain **git**. The acq kit
fetch uses `git` directly. If your machine has a global git credential helper or
a `url.<x>.insteadOf` rewrite (common in enterprise/egress setups), git tries to
*authenticate* to the kit source and — failing — drops into an interactive
prompt (and GitHub disabled git password auth in 2021, so it can't succeed).

### Fix

Wire git to use your `gh` token, once:

```
gh auth setup-git
```

If it still prompts, you likely have a rewrite forcing auth on the clone —
inspect it with:

```
git config --global --get-regexp 'url\..*insteadOf'
```

### Prevention

As of #207, acq's kit fetch is **non-interactive**: it sets `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`
and first attempts an anonymous fetch with any inherited credential helper /
`github.com` `insteadOf` rewrite neutralized (so an unauthenticated fetch
proceeds without prompting), then retries once with your system git config
(still prompt-disabled) for sources that require auth (enterprise mirror, etc.).
It can no longer hang on a
prompt; a genuine failure now prints this remedy.

## 27. `500 failed to create network` After a Host Restart (sbx)

> Numbered 27 to avoid colliding with entry 26 (macOS Gatekeeper / `mkfs.erofs`),
> which is landing in a separate change.

### Symptoms

A sandbox that worked before is refused after a **host reboot/restart**. The
image pull succeeds ("Already exists" / "Image is up to date"), then sandbox
creation fails:

```
Status: Image is up to date for docker/sandbox-templates:opencode-docker
ERROR: request failed: 500 Internal Server Error: failed to create network
```

(Sometimes with the daemon detail `Error response from daemon: already exists`.)
`./acq run …` and a direct `sbx run …` fail identically — `acq` only passes the
command through to `sbx`.

### Root Cause

This is an **`sbx` daemon-lifecycle bug**, not a Quickstart / `acq` / `msb` issue
and not a network-policy problem. On an unclean shutdown/reboot, `sbx`'s daemon
(`sandboxd`) does not tear down a sandbox's network, so a **stale network record
survives the restart**. On the next `sbx run`, sandboxd tries to (re)create that
network, hits the leftover entry, and returns `500 … already exists`. The
successful image pull just before the error is unrelated — the failure is the
network-create step that follows it.

Tracked upstream (already open — no new report needed):

- [docker/sbx-releases#181](https://github.com/docker/sbx-releases/issues/181) —
  `500 failed to create network: … already exists`.
- [docker/sbx-releases#353](https://github.com/docker/sbx-releases/issues/353) —
  sandboxd crash during dead-VM cleanup orphans a sandbox; the only documented
  recovery is a full `sbx reset`.

### Fix

Recover least-destructive first:

1. **List and clear the stale sandbox.** See what `sbx` still thinks exists, then
   remove the orphaned one and retry:

   ```bash
   sbx ls
   sbx rm <name> --force      # <name> from the list; stop it first if running
   ./acq run opencode <path>
   ```

   (If `sbx rm --force` reports "not found" but the name is still claimed, that is
   [docker/sbx-releases#129](https://github.com/docker/sbx-releases/issues/129) —
   go to step 2.)

2. **Full reset, preserving secrets** — the recovery the upstream issues cite.
   This clears stale daemon/network state but keeps your USAi/GitHub secrets so
   you do not redo secret setup:

   ```bash
   sbx reset --preserve-secrets
   ```

   After a reset you may need to re-apply the network policy before running:

   ```bash
   sbx policy init balanced
   sbx policy allow network "api.gsa.usai.gov"
   ./acq run opencode <path>
   ```

### Prevention / Status

- This is an upstream `sbx` daemon-shutdown bug; we cannot fix it in this repo.
  Follow [docker/sbx-releases#181](https://github.com/docker/sbx-releases/issues/181)
  / [#353](https://github.com/docker/sbx-releases/issues/353) for the daemon-side
  fix.
- Until then, `sbx reset --preserve-secrets` is the reliable recovery after a
  restart leaves a sandbox unusable. (`--preserve-secrets` avoids re-running the
  Step 3 secret setup.)

## 28. msb May Auto-Run a `--script-path`-Registered Script at Boot (Re-Verify on Version Bump)

### Symptoms

Not a bug you hit today — a **latent** failure to watch for after a microsandbox
(`msb`) version bump. If a future msb release starts auto-executing a registered
`--script-path` script at guest boot, kit `startup` commands could run **twice**
on a resume: once from microsandbox's own boot replay, and again from acq's
`start`/`restart` heal (which re-runs the startup phase via `msb exec`).

### Root Cause

The acq msb adapter stages kit `startup` commands as a create-time script
registered with `--script-path acq-startup:<hostfile>` (ADR-0017). This is only
safe/runtime-neutral because, on the pinned msb version, a bare `--script-path`
registration merely places the script on the guest PATH
(`/.msb/scripts/acq-startup`) — microsandbox does **not** auto-run it at boot.
Boot replay is driven only by a persisted `LaunchConfig.startup`
(`runtime.entrypoint`/`runtime.cmd`), which acq never populates. This was
confirmed against microsandbox source (`crates/cli/lib/commands/start.rs`,
`restart.rs`, `Sandbox::start_detached()`).

This is a **load-bearing, unverifiable-from-this-repo assumption**: it depends on
microsandbox internals that could change in a future release.

### Prevention / Re-Verification

On each msb version bump (part of the quarterly re-verification cadence), confirm
`--script-path` boot-inertness still holds:

```bash
# Create a sandbox with a sentinel startup command staged via --script-path,
# then stop + start it WITHOUT going through acq, and check the sentinel ran
# 0 times (inert) rather than 1 (auto-run at boot):
msb create --name inert-probe --script-path acq-startup:/path/to/sentinel.sh <image>
msb stop inert-probe && msb start inert-probe
# inspect: the sentinel's side effect must NOT have fired on the bare start
msb rm inert-probe
```

If a future msb **does** auto-run the registered script at boot, the adapter must
stop double-running startup — e.g. drop the acq `start`/`restart` heal's
startup re-run for msb, or stop staging the script. See the "VERIFIED NEUTRALITY
ASSUMPTION" note in `_acq_msb_stage_startup_script` (`acq.backends/msb.sh`).

## 29. `opencode-ai's postinstall script was not run` on a Fresh sbx Sandbox

### Symptoms

A newly created **sbx** `opencode` sandbox fails at launch (the image pull
succeeds, then the agent exits 1):

```
Error: opencode-ai's postinstall script was not run.

This occurs when using --ignore-scripts during installation, or when using a
package manager like pnpm that does not run postinstall scripts by default.

To fix this, run the postinstall script manually:
  cd node_modules/opencode-ai && node postinstall.mjs
```

Often appears right after a fresh image pull. Seen with `opencode-ai@1.18.12` on
macOS/Apple Silicon, sbx v0.37.1.

### Root Cause

This is in the **Docker `sandbox-templates:opencode-docker` image**, not in
`acq`, the quickstart, or your local setup. On the **sbx** backend opencode is
baked into that image (acq does not install it — that only happens on the msb
backend). Since opencode v1.15.1, the `opencode-ai` npm package needs its
**postinstall** step to fetch the actual platform binary. The image appears to
install `opencode-ai` at **build time** with lifecycle scripts skipped (e.g.
`npm ci --ignore-scripts`, or pnpm/bun which skip postinstall by default), so the
binary is missing in the shipped image and opencode's guard fires on first run.

Evidence it is a build-time script-skip, not your environment (run inside the
sandbox): `npm config get ignore-scripts` returns `false` (so nothing is
disabling scripts at runtime), yet `npm ls -g opencode-ai` shows the package
present without a working binary — the postinstall simply never ran when the
image was built.

Not a supply-chain compromise and not related to the recent quickstart changes;
a fresh image pull just fetched a newer opencode build with this gap.

### Fix

**As of the current `acq`, `acq run opencode <path>` remediates this
automatically:** before attaching an opencode agent, acq probes
`opencode --version` in the sandbox and, if the binary is not functional, runs
the package's `postinstall.mjs` (on either backend), then attaches. So the
normal flow should now just work; if it still fails, apply the manual fix below.

Apply the manual fix with **`sbx exec`**, not `sbx run`. `sbx run` (the raw
backend command, without acq's remediation) **launches opencode**, which
re-hits the missing-binary guard and exits before you can do anything. `sbx
exec` runs a command in the sandbox **without launching the agent**, so it works
even when a raw `run` fails.

```bash
# 1. Find the sandbox that was created (its name, e.g. opencode-<project>):
sbx ls

# 2. Run opencode's postinstall inside it via sbx exec (no agent launch):
sbx exec <sandbox-name> -- sh -c 'cd "$(npm root -g)/opencode-ai" && node postinstall.mjs'
sbx exec <sandbox-name> -- opencode --version   # confirm the binary now runs

# 3. Now attach normally:
./acq run opencode <path>          # or: sbx run <sandbox-name>
```

If `sbx exec` reports the sandbox is not running, start it first
(`sbx start <sandbox-name>`) then re-run the exec.

> Note: a raw `sbx run <sandbox-name>` (bypassing acq) just re-triggers the
> error. Prefer `acq run`, which remediates automatically; the `sbx exec` path
> above is the manual fallback if remediation ever fails.

### Prevention / Status

- `acq run opencode` now runs the postinstall automatically before attach (both
  backends), so the common case is handled without user action.
- The underlying image gap is built and shipped by Docker; we cannot fix it in
  this repo. An upstream report has been filed:
  [docker/sbx-releases#395](https://github.com/docker/sbx-releases/issues/395).
  Related upstream: [anomalyco/opencode#27906](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/27906)
  (opencode requires postinstall to fetch its binary since v1.15.1).
- If acq's automatic remediation ever fails, the manual `node postinstall.mjs`
  above is the reliable per-sandbox workaround.
- The **msb** backend installs opencode itself (`npm install -g`, scripts
  enabled) rather than using this image, so it is a possible alternative if the
  sbx image stays broken — though it may hit the same opencode packaging issue.

## 30. Sandbox can't reach USAi / GitHub / npm — three signatures, three fixes

### Symptoms

Early in `acq run`, an outbound request from inside the sandbox fails and (before
this was disambiguated) acq could mis-report it as an expired key and prompt to
rotate:

```
agentic-coding-playbook: fetch of GSA-TTS/agentic-coding-playbook@… tarball failed
  curl: (56) OpenSSL SSL_read: … unexpected eof while reading, errno 0

Your USAi API key looks invalid or expired (HTTP …000 from the models API).
```

Rotating the key never helps here — the failure is in the network path, not the
key. But "the sandbox can't reach the network" is not one problem: three distinct
failures share overlapping symptoms and need **different** remedies. Identify
which one you have before acting.

### Triage — which signature is it?

| Signature (from inside the guest) | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Broad** `curl (56) unexpected eof` / HTTP `000` on **multiple** hosts at once (USAi *and* GitHub *and* npm) | Corrupted / stale **msb state** (not a clean-install behavior) | **Wipe msb data + reinstall, then `msb doctor`** (below) |
| **USAi only** fails with `NXDOMAIN` / `curl rc=6` (or a WAF-gated API such as GitLab's `/api/v4/*` returns `403` from `awselb/2.0`), while GitHub + npm work fine | **Split-horizon DNS** — the host resolves the name to a private tunnel address (`100.64.x` on ZPA); a public resolver returns the public endpoint, which the WAF rejects, and msb's rebind protection drops the private answer | Let the guest follow the host's resolvers with rebind protection off, which acq does automatically on a host whose resolvers are in `100.64/10`: unset `ACQ_MSB_DNS_NAMESERVER` and `ACQ_MSB_DNS_REBIND_PROTECTION`, or set the latter to `0` if the sandbox was created while the tunnel was down (below) |
| A **genuinely intercepted** endpoint fails its TLS handshake behind a corporate proxy that terminates it | The proxy's **root CA** isn't trusted on msb's upstream (proxy→server) leg | acq passes it via `--tls-upstream-ca-cert` (defense-in-depth; below) |

Probe from inside the sandbox to read the signature — the curl exit code is the
discriminator (`6` = didn't resolve; `35`/`56` or `000` = resolved but the
connection was cut):

```bash
# msb
msb exec <sandbox> -- curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -v https://api.gsa.usai.gov/api/v1/models
msb exec <sandbox> -- curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -v https://api.github.com
# sbx
sbx exec <sandbox> -- curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -v https://api.gsa.usai.gov/api/v1/models
```

For a deeper host-side characterization (interception vs egress path, DNS,
host-vs-host comparison), run the bundled read-only probes:

```bash
./scripts/diagnose-tls-intercept        # classify interception / cert-trust / egress path
./scripts/diagnose-host-egress-diff      # compare a failing host to a working one
```

### Signature 1 — broad `unexpected eof` on multiple hosts (stale msb state)

Observed in the field on a Zscaler-enrolled macOS host: **every** outbound HTTPS
call from the guest failed at once with `curl (56) unexpected eof`. It did **not**
reproduce on a clean install — a machine with the same Zscaler configuration
worked fine — and it was cleared by a **full msb data wipe + reinstall**. The
matching upstream report ([superradcompany/microsandbox#1344](https://github.com/superradcompany/microsandbox/issues/1344))
was **closed as non-reproducible**: something in the local msb state was corrupt,
not a defect in a clean msb.

**Fix:** wipe msb's data/state and reinstall, then confirm host readiness:

```bash
# Reinstall msb (removes and re-lays its runtime state)
curl -fsSL https://install.microsandbox.dev | sh

# Verify host virtualization + runtime prerequisites; --fix applies supported setup
msb doctor
msb doctor --fix
```

If a broad `unexpected eof` **recurs on a clean install**, that would be new
evidence of an msb bug — capture the `diagnose-*` output and reopen
[superradcompany/microsandbox#1344](https://github.com/superradcompany/microsandbox/issues/1344).

### Signature 2 — split-horizon DNS (USAi NXDOMAIN, GitLab API 403)

On a GFE/Zscaler host, GitHub and npm resolve and return `200` from the guest,
but `api.gsa.usai.gov` fails to **resolve** (`curl rc=6`), or a WAF-gated API
behind the same tunnel (GitLab's `/api/v4/*`) answers `403` from `awselb/2.0`
while its git endpoints work. Both are the same mechanism. The host's Zscaler
resolvers answer these names with **private ZPA addresses** (`100.64.x`) that
ride the tunnel's allow-listed path; a public resolver answers the public load
balancer, which the WAF rejects. And even with the host resolver, msb's DNS
rebind protection drops private-range answers, so the name resolves to nothing.

acq's defaults handle this: the guest follows the host's resolvers (no
`--dns-nameserver`), and when a host resolver is in `100.64/10` (the ZPA
signature) msb is created with `--no-dns-rebind-protection`, with a one-line
notice on stderr. If you see this signature, check that neither knob is
overriding the defaults, and that the sandbox was not created while the tunnel
was down (detection then sees no `100.64/10` resolver and keeps the protection):

```bash
unset ACQ_MSB_DNS_NAMESERVER            # a forced public resolver reintroduces the 403/NXDOMAIN
unset ACQ_MSB_DNS_REBIND_PROTECTION     # =1 drops the private tunnel answers
ACQ_MSB_DNS_REBIND_PROTECTION=0 acq …   # recreate: force it off if detection missed
```

The setting is applied at create time; recreate the sandbox after changing it.
Keeping rebind protection on is a deliberate trade: it stops a kit-allowed
domain from being resolved into private space by an attacker-influenced DNS
answer, and it also stops every tunnel-only host from resolving at all. See the
DNS section of `docs/BACKEND_GUIDE.md` for the detection rule and the
mitigations that remain with it off.

Verified on msb 0.6.16: from the guest, `gitlab.login.gov` resolves to its ZPA
address, `/api/v4/user` with the bound token returns `200`, and the USAi models
endpoint returns `401` (reachable) instead of failing to resolve. The guest's
public egress IP is unchanged (still the Zscaler cloud). Earlier text here
reported the internal resolver as unreachable from the guest; that predates
msb's host-side network stack and no longer applies.

`acq` reports this distinctly ("did not RESOLVE … likely a split-horizon name")
rather than as a generic network cut or a bad key.

### Signature 3 — genuine TLS interception (upstream CA trust, defense-in-depth)

When a corporate proxy (Zscaler, Netskope, …) **genuinely terminates** an
endpoint, acq's `--tls-intercept` (which msb needs to substitute injected secrets
on the wire) makes msb's host-side proxy re-originate an *upstream* TLS connection
to that proxy — which presents a corporate-signed leaf. That upstream leg must
trust the **corporate root**. `--trust-host-cas` does not help (it only ships CAs
into the guest, not into the proxy's upstream verifier), and msb's native-cert
loader surfaces enterprise roots unevenly on macOS. When the root isn't surfaced,
the upstream handshake fails *after* the guest-facing TLS completed and the guest
sees `unexpected eof`.

acq passes the host's root CAs to that upstream verifier via
`--tls-upstream-ca-cert` whenever interception is on, so a genuinely-terminated
endpoint verifies even when native-cert loading would miss the root. Controls:

- `ACQ_MSB_UPSTREAM_CA_CERT=/path/to/root.pem` — trust an explicit PEM
  (colon- or space-separated for several). Highest precedence; use it on
  non-macOS hosts or when you already have the root on disk.
- `ACQ_MSB_UPSTREAM_CA_AUTODETECT=0` — disable the macOS auto-export of the host
  search-list roots (on by default).
- `ACQ_MSB_NO_UPSTREAM_CA=1` — reproduction/testing only: withhold the upstream CA
  even when available.

This is **defense-in-depth for the interception case only** — it does not address
Signature 1 (stale state) or Signature 2 (split-horizon DNS).

### Prevention / Status

- `acq` classifies an in-guest curl result and reports the matching diagnosis:
  `unresolved` (DNS/split-horizon) vs `unreachable` (connection cut) vs a real
  HTTP status — never "invalid or expired" for a network failure, and it does not
  prompt to rotate a good key. It fails closed (aborts the run) rather than attach
  a session that cannot reach USAi.
- The in-guest `npm install` failure message is likewise disambiguated: it
  distinguishes a genuinely-missing npm from an unreachable / unresolvable
  registry, so a network cut is not misread as "node isn't installed."
- The built-in kits are ordered so `zscaler-ca-certificate` is applied first, so
  guest-side CA trust is established before the other kits make network requests
  (this matters on the sbx backend, whose kits apply sequentially).
- Making the sandbox's outbound TLS traverse a corporate proxy, and giving the
  guest a resolver that can see internal zones, are host/network-configuration
  matters — resolve them with your network/endpoint administrators where acq's
  tunables don't cover your environment.

## 26. macOS Gatekeeper Blocks `mkfs.erofs` at `sbx policy init` (PATH shadowing)

### Symptoms

On macOS (seen on **Tahoe / macOS 26**, Apple Silicon), `sbx policy init balanced`
— the first command that builds a sandbox filesystem — fails when macOS blocks a
helper binary:

```
"mkfs.erofs" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.
macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware.
```

`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /opt/homebrew/bin/mkfs.erofs` does **not** clear
it — even run with `sudo`. It only happens on machines that also have Homebrew
`erofs-utils` installed; users without it never see the block.

### Root Cause

This is an **`sbx` PATH-resolution bug**, **not** a Quickstart / `acq` / `msb`
issue, and **not** a supply-chain compromise. sbx ships its own **notarized**
`mkfs.erofs`, but invokes it via `$PATH`, so a Homebrew `erofs-utils` shadows the
bundled copy:

- sbx v0.37.1 bundles a notarized `mkfs.erofs` at
  `/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/sbx/<version>/libexec/mkfs.erofs`
  (`spctl` → *accepted*; Developer ID: **Docker Inc (9BNSXJN65R)**).
- If Homebrew `erofs-utils` is also installed, `/opt/homebrew/bin/mkfs.erofs`
  (a symlink into `Cellar/erofs-utils/…`) is earlier on `$PATH`. That binary is
  **ad-hoc-signed / not notarized** (`spctl` → *rejected*, `Signature=adhoc`,
  no TeamIdentifier).
- sbx resolves `mkfs.erofs` from `$PATH`, picks up the unnotarized Homebrew
  binary instead of its own, and macOS Gatekeeper rejects it.
- There is **no `com.apple.quarantine` xattr** on the rejected binary — the block
  is the code-signing / AMFI (`syspolicyd`) assessment, which is why removing the
  xattr does nothing.

The `erofs-utils` Homebrew formula itself is fine (kernel.org source,
SHA256-pinned bottles). The problem is purely that sbx's PATH lookup picks the
unnotarized system copy over its own notarized bundled one.

### Fix

Make sbx use its own notarized binary — remove the shadowing Homebrew copy from
PATH:

```bash
brew uninstall erofs-utils    # if nothing else needs it; sbx then uses its bundled, notarized mkfs.erofs
```

If you cannot remove it, approve the Homebrew binary via **System Settings →
Privacy & Security → "Allow Anyway"**, then re-run the command and click **"Open"**
on the pop-up. Do **not** rely on `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine` — it does not
satisfy the code-signing gate on an unnotarized binary.

### Prevention / Status

- The durable fix is upstream in `sbx`: invoke the bundled
  `libexec/mkfs.erofs` by absolute path rather than resolving `mkfs.erofs` from
  `$PATH`. The bundled binary is already notarized, so no notarization change is
  needed. Tracked at
  [docker/sbx-releases#392](https://github.com/docker/sbx-releases/issues/392).
- Until sbx pins the path, `brew uninstall erofs-utils` (or the "Allow Anyway"
  fallback) unblocks affected machines.

## 31. msb Balanced-Egress Host List Drifts from the sbx `balanced` Policy

### Symptoms

On the **msb** backend a host that works on sbx (which uses the `balanced`
policy) is refused from inside the sandbox — a `curl`/package-manager fetch fails
to connect, or an install that succeeds on sbx times out on msb. Conversely, the
msb host list may reference hosts sbx `balanced` has since removed.

### Root Cause

The msb backend mirrors the sbx `balanced` egress set from a **vendored,
point-in-time snapshot** at `acq.backends/msb-balanced-hosts.txt` (see ADR-0018).
sbx generates its `balanced` policy in the daemon; that list is **not** stored in
this repo, so when sbx updates `balanced`, the vendored mirror goes stale until a
human re-syncs it. (This is a deliberate tradeoff — the alternative, shelling out
to `sbx policy inspect` at msb-create time, requires sbx installed on an msb-only
host and couples the backends.)

### Fix / Re-sync

Re-sync the vendored file from a machine that has sbx with the `balanced` policy:

```bash
# 1. Inspect the active sbx policy and copy the network `allow` host:port rows.
sbx policy inspect local-policy

# 2. Diff them against the vendored mirror (network rows only; NOT the
#    filesystem:read/write rows).
$EDITOR acq.backends/msb-balanced-hosts.txt
```

Copy each `allow … network` `host:port` row verbatim into the matching group in
the file (do **not** pre-translate wildcards or ports — the msb adapter's
`_acq_msb_balanced_rules_into` does that). Commit the diff. The offline test
suite (`scripts/test-acq-bats`) re-parses the real file and fails if any line is
malformed, so run it after editing.

As a stopgap for a single missing host, either add it to a site-specific list and
point `ACQ_MSB_BALANCED_HOSTS_FILE` at it, or (for a one-off) create with an extra
`--net-rule allow@<host>:tcp:443`.

### Prevention / Status

- Re-verify on the **quarterly review cadence** (per `AGENTS.md` periodic
  re-verification): re-run `sbx policy inspect local-policy` and diff the network
  rows against `acq.backends/msb-balanced-hosts.txt`.
- A future option (ADR-0018 "Alternatives considered") is to move the list into a
  shared neutral kit consumed by both backends, removing the manual re-sync.

## 32. msb `create`/`run` Fails: `the dns target supports tcp, udp, or any, not dns`

> **Status: RESOLVED for supported versions.** microsandbox **0.6.9** shipped the
> upstream release-build parser fix for the `allow@dns` macro, and acq now
> requires **msb >= 0.6.9** (`MIN_MSB_VERSION` in `acq.backends/msb.sh`). The msb
> adapter emits the native `allow@dns` macro for the gateway-DNS grant again; the
> expanded `allow@host:udp:53` + `allow@host:tcp:53` workaround has been removed.
> Because the floor fails closed on anything older than 0.6.9, a supported acq
> install can no longer hit this failure. The reproduction and root-cause history
> below is retained for context.

### Symptoms (historical, msb <= 0.6.8)

On the **msb** backend, `acq run`/`acq create` (or a raw `msb create`/`msb run`)
aborts during "Creating sandbox …" with:

```
error: the `dns` target supports `tcp`, `udp`, or `any`, not `dns`
acq(msb): error: 'msb create' failed for '<sandbox>'.
```

Reproduces with the minimal case on a released msb (confirmed on msb 0.6.8):

```bash
msb run --net-default deny --net-rule "allow@dns" alpine -- true
```

### Root Cause (historical, msb 0.6.7–0.6.8)

An **upstream msb bug** in the `--net-rule` parser, not an acq misconfiguration.
msb's semantic `allow@dns` macro was parsed by advancing past the `dns` target
token inside a `debug_assert_eq!(parts.next(), Some("dns"))`. `debug_assert!` is
compiled **out** of a release binary, so in the shipped `msb` the iterator was
never advanced past `dns`; the same `dns` token was then read as the **protocol**
field, which only accepts `tcp`/`udp`/`any` — hence the error. A bare
`allow@dns` therefore hard-failed on release builds **from 0.6.7 through 0.6.8**
(fixed in 0.6.9; see Fix below), even though the macro was documented as valid.

The balanced-egress baseline (ADR-0018) needs a gateway-DNS grant under
`--net-default deny`, and originally emitted `allow@dns`, tripping this bug on
pre-0.6.9 release builds.

### Fix

microsandbox **0.6.9** fixed the parser: the target-iterator advance was moved
OUT of the `debug_assert_eq!`, so it now runs on release binaries too and a bare
`allow@dns` parses correctly. acq raised `MIN_MSB_VERSION` to **0.6.9** and
collapsed the former expanded workaround back to the native macro:

```
--net-rule allow@dns
```

This is emitted in `_acq_msb_balanced_rules_into` (and the strict-tier path) in
`acq.backends/msb.sh`. The earlier workaround emitted the expanded equivalent
(`--net-rule allow@host:udp:53 --net-rule allow@host:tcp:53`) so that pre-0.6.9
release builds could still resolve DNS under a deny-default; that is no longer
needed now that the floor guarantees a fixed parser. If you script raw `msb`
calls against a 0.6.9+ binary, `allow@dns` is safe to use directly.

### Prevention / Status

- **Resolved.** The version floor (`MIN_MSB_VERSION=0.6.9`) fails closed on any
  older binary before a create is attempted, so acq cannot reach this failure on
  a supported install. If a future regression is suspected, re-run the minimal
  `msb run … --net-rule "allow@dns"` case above on the quarterly review cadence to
  confirm the macro still parses.

## 33. `--kit` Services Dead After a Resume/Reboot on msb — Ports Mapped, Nothing Listening

### Symptoms

On the **msb** backend, after a host reboot (or any `acq stop`/`acq start`,
`acq restart`, or `acq run <existing-sandbox>` that resumes a stopped sandbox),
a sandbox created with an extra CLI kit — e.g.
`acq run opencode --kit …/acq-kits/openchamber …` — comes back with the kit's
published ports still mapped, but **nothing answering behind them**:

```
$ acq ports opencode-agentic-coding
sandbox 3000 -> host 127.0.0.1:3000 (create-time -p)
sandbox 4096 -> host 127.0.0.1:4096 (create-time -p)

$ opencode attach http://127.0.0.1:4096
Error: Unable to connect. Is the computer able to access the url?
```

An `acq exec <sandbox> -- ps -ef` shows **no `opencode serve`, no `openchamber`,
and — the tell — no `supervisor:` respawn loops** at all. This is distinct from a
startup *race* (§ the wrapper's "shared server not answering yet on :4096"),
where the supervisor processes ARE present and merely still warming up: here the
supervisors were never (re-)launched, so the ports forward into a guest with the
kit's services entirely absent.

### Root Cause

A kit's `startup`-phase commands (which, for the openchamber kit, launch the
supervised shared `opencode serve` on :4096 and the OpenChamber UI on :3000; for
the paseo kit, the daemon supervisor on :6767) are re-run on a resume **only** by
acq's heal (`acq_backend_ensure_kits_applied`) — `msb start` alone does not replay
them (ADR-0017). Two compounding gaps kept those services dead on resume:

1. **The heal skipped CLI `--kit` kits.** It re-applied only the built-in kits and
   any `ACQ_EXTRA_KITS`; it did not fold in kits supplied on the command line via
   `--kit` (`ACQ_CLI_KITS`). Fixed by appending `ACQ_CLI_KITS` to the heal's kit
   list — but that only helps when the array is populated.

2. **The `--kit`/extra refs were never persisted.** `ACQ_CLI_KITS` is populated by
   `extract_kit_flags` in the `run`/`create` dispatch arm only, and
   `ACQ_EXTRA_KITS` is a bare environment variable. A later `acq start` /
   `acq restart` (or a name-only `acq run <sandbox>`) does not re-parse `--kit` and
   may run in a shell that never exported `ACQ_EXTRA_KITS`, so the heal ran with an
   **empty** CLI/extra set and re-ran only the built-ins' startup. The provision
   path *does* fold `--kit` in, so the create-time `-p` port mappings are part of
   the persisted sandbox config and are restored by msb on start — but the heal
   skipped the kit whose `startup` phase brings the services up. Result: ports
   restored, services not — exactly the "mapped but dead" state above.

### Fix

Both gaps are closed:

- `acq_backend_ensure_kits_applied` (msb) appends `ACQ_CLI_KITS` to the heal's kit
  list, matching how `acq_backend_provision` assembles the kit set.
- acq now **persists** the CLI (`--kit`) and `ACQ_EXTRA_KITS` refs host-side at
  provision (a small `*.kits` record beside the bundle-provenance record, keyed by
  backend + sandbox name) and **reloads** them in the `acq start` / `acq restart`
  verbs and on a name-only `acq run <sandbox>` re-attach, *before* the heal. So a
  `msb stop` + `acq start` cycle now re-runs a `--kit` kit's startup automatically
  — **you no longer have to re-pass `--kit`.** The record's presence is
  authoritative: a sandbox created with no CLI/extra kits reloads nothing, and a
  legacy sandbox with no record behaves exactly as before (reload is a no-op).

To recover a **legacy** sandbox (created before this fix, so it has no persisted
record) without recreating it, resume it once with the SAME `--kit` ref you
created it with, which both re-runs the kit's startup and writes the record for
next time:

```bash
acq run opencode --kit …/acq-kits/openchamber <path>   # heals + re-runs kit startup
# or, if you don't need to attach:
acq restart <sandbox>       # on a sandbox created by a fixed acq, this now
                            # restores CLI-kit startup on its own
```

If a resumed sandbox is already up but its services are dead, the quickest manual
kick is to re-run the kit's startup script directly:

```bash
acq exec <sandbox> -- sh /home/agent/openchamber-start.sh &
# (paseo kit: sh /home/agent/paseo-start.sh)
```

### Prevention / Status

- Fixed in `acq.backends/msb.sh` (heal folds CLI kits), `acq.backends/common.sh`
  (`acq_cli_kits_write`/`acq_cli_kits_load` persistence), `acq.backends/sbx.sh`
  (parity write), and the `acq` `start`/`restart`/`run` verbs (reload before
  heal). Covered by the `clikit-heal` and `cli-kits:*` unit tests in
  `test/bats/` (persist-then-reload round-trip; a reloaded `--kit` ref is
  re-applied during a resume heal).
- Note the operational fact behind the original report: a live in-VM session does
  **not** survive a host reboot — the microVM is ephemeral; only the sandbox
  definition, its port config, and your mounted repos persist. Always commit work
  to the mounted repos before shutting down, and expect to start a fresh agent
  session (not reattach the old one) after a reboot.

## 34. Git signing fails on msb: socat missing or msb < 0.6.9

### Symptoms

On the **msb** backend, committing inside the guest fails to sign:

```
[git-ssh-sign] no SSH agent - cannot sign commits
```

or `acq` printed a warning at create/attach about `socat` not being found in the
guest image, or a *"host ssh-agent forwarding needs msb >= 0.6.9"* warning and
then skipped the forward.

### Root Cause

`acq` forwards the host ssh-agent into an msb guest with
`--vsock $SSH_AUTH_SOCK:3552/stream` and then runs an **in-guest `socat` bridge**
that re-exposes the vsock route as the unix socket
`/home/agent/.acq/ssh-agent.sock` (exported as `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`). Two things must
hold for that to work:

1. **msb >= 0.6.9** — `--vsock` first appears in msb 0.6.9. On an older msb, acq
   warns and **skips** the forward (fail-soft), so the guest has no agent.
2. **`socat` present in the guest image** — the bridge is `socat`. It is **not**
   auto-installed (guest egress is locked, so a package mirror is unreachable);
   acq warns if it is missing and the bridge cannot start.

The forward is also **opt-in via the host `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`**: if no agent is
running on the host (or no key is loaded), there is nothing to forward.

### Fix

- **Upgrade msb** to >= 0.6.9 (`msb self update`).
- **Ensure `socat` is in `ACQ_MSB_IMAGE`** — the default
  `docker/sandbox-templates:shell-docker` ships it; a custom override must too.
- **Ensure the host has an agent with a key loaded** before running `acq`:

  ```bash
  eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"   # if none is running
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 # load your signing key
  echo "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK"     # must be set — this is the opt-in signal
  ```

Then re-run `acq run …`; the forward is applied automatically. See
[ADR-0021](adr/0021-msb-host-ssh-agent-forwarding-via-vsock.md) for the full
mechanism and the trust-boundary discussion.

### Variant: `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` unset on re-attach to a running sandbox

A distinct signature of the same feature: signing works right after the initial
`acq run` but **fails on a later re-attach** to the *same, still-running*
sandbox, and it starts working again as soon as you
`export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/home/agent/.acq/ssh-agent.sock` by hand. Here the vsock
route and the `socat` bridge are fine — what is missing is the
**`SSH_AUTH_SOCK` env var in the agent's process**. acq injects that var
(`-e SSH_AUTH_SOCK=…`) only when the persisted `/var/lib/acq/ssh-auth-sock`
marker is present, and before the fix nothing re-established the bridge or wrote
that marker when re-attaching to an already-running sandbox (the heal's
start-if-stopped block is a no-op on a running sandbox, and only that path — or
provision — wrote the marker).

Fixed in `acq.backends/msb.sh`: `acq_backend_ensure_kits_applied` now calls
`_acq_msb_ensure_ssh_agent_forward` at the top of the heal, which re-drives the
forward (restart the bridge + write the marker) on every re-attach when both a
host forward is requested (`SSH_AUTH_SOCK` set) **and** the sandbox carries the
create-time `--vsock` route. The route is create-time only, so a sandbox created
*without* a host agent still needs a recreate to gain forwarding — but one
created *with* the route now re-injects `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` on every re-attach without
a manual export. See [ADR-0021](adr/0021-msb-host-ssh-agent-forwarding-via-vsock.md)
("Re-attach to a running sandbox").

### Variant: forwarded agent unreachable after a host reboot (stale `--vsock` route)

Another distinct signature, and the one that a manual
`export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=…` does **not** fix: signing worked before, then after the
**host machine was rebooted** (especially an unclean reboot that did not stop the
sandbox first) a resume + re-attach leaves the guest unable to reach the agent —
`ssh-add -l` inside the guest returns `error fetching identities: communication
with agent failed`, and committing fails to sign — even though `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is
set on both the host and in the guest, the host agent holds the key, and the
in-guest `socat` bridge is running. Probing the bridge by hand shows the tell:

```
$ socat -T2 - VSOCK-CONNECT:2:3552 </dev/null
E connect(…, cid:2 port:3552, …): Connection reset by peer
```

`Connection reset by peer` on the vsock connect means **the host side of the
route has no live listener**. The `--vsock HOST_PATH:3552` route is emitted
**only at create time** and pins `HOST_PATH` to the host's `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` path
captured then; it is persisted in the sandbox config and **never re-derived** on
`msb start` or re-attach. A host reboot restarts the host ssh-agent under a *new*
socket path, so the persisted route now points at a dead host endpoint. This is
distinct from the previous variant: there the guest env var was missing; here the
env var and bridge are present but the route's host end is dead.

`acq` now **detects and reports** this instead of leaving a silent dead bridge:
after (re)starting the bridge, `_acq_msb_start_ssh_agent_bridge` runs a liveness
probe (`ssh-add -l` over the guest sock) and, on failure, prints an actionable
warning naming the host-reboot cause and the remedy. Because the bridge's
listener socket is present (only its vsock backend is dead), `ssh-add` exits **1**
with `communication with agent failed` here — the same exit code as a healthy but
empty agent, so the probe classifies on the message (a "no identities" reply is
treated as healthy and stays quiet). The `--vsock` route is create-time only, so
the fix is to **recreate the sandbox** to refresh the route:

```bash
acq rm <sandbox>
# then re-run your original create/run WITH the host agent available:
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"; ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519   # if needed
acq run <agent> <workspace…>
```

See [ADR-0021](adr/0021-msb-host-ssh-agent-forwarding-via-vsock.md)
("Re-attach to a running sandbox") for the full mechanism.

## 35. Re-attach Heal Loop Warns Every Time on sbx 0.38 — `sbx kit add` Refuses Startup-Bearing Kits

### Symptoms

On the **sbx** backend (sbx >= 0.38), every re-attach to an existing sandbox
(`acq run <name>`) reports the sandbox is "missing the playbook kit", re-attempts
every extra kit, and each `sbx kit add` warn-fails — on **every** attach, even
for a sandbox that was provisioned correctly. Running the printed recover command
by hand shows the real cause:

```
$ sbx kit add <sandbox> <translated-playbook-kit-dir>
ERROR: kit "agentic-coding-playbook" declares setup.startup, which the kit-add
recreate flow does not yet apply; recreate the sandbox from scratch via
`sbx rm` + `sbx create --kit` to use this kit
```

### Root Cause

Three issues compounded:

1. **sbx 0.38 refuses startup-bearing kits mid-life.** `sbx kit add` on 0.38 only
   applies mixin kits declaring exclusively `environment.variables`,
   `setup.install`, and `permissions.network.allow`
   ([Docker kits docs](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/customize/kits/)). Every
   built-in acq kit declares startup commands (translated into `setup.startup`), so
   **all** mid-life built-in kit adds are refused. acq swallowed sbx's stderr
   (`sbx kit add … >/dev/null 2>&1`) and printed a generic warning plus a
   "Recover with: sbx kit add …" hint that could never succeed.
2. **A stale playbook feature-probe.** The heal probed the playbook with
   `test -e "$HOME/.agentic-coding-playbook/.git"`. Since patterns v1.8.0 moved
   playbook delivery from a git clone to a REST tarball (the #203 fix), the tree
   has **no `.git`**, so the probe reported the playbook absent on every re-attach,
   forever — re-triggering the (now-refused) add each time.
3. **The `~/.acq-extra-kits` marker was never written at create.** The re-attach
   heal decided whether an extra kit was already applied by reading
   `~/.acq-extra-kits`, but only the heal path wrote it. A sandbox created **with**
   `ACQ_EXTRA_KITS` (or `--kit`) never got the marker, so every re-attach
   re-attempted every extra kit (and, under (1), warn-failed).

### Fix

`acq` (this repo):

- Captures `sbx kit add` stderr and **detects the startup refusal**, printing a
  single actionable "recreate to extend/refresh" message
  (`acq rm <name> && acq run …`) instead of per-kit warnings with recover
  commands that cannot work. Other (genuine) failures now surface sbx's own
  diagnostic rather than being hidden. `acq kit update` fails with the same
  guidance. acq does **not** auto-recreate (a recreate discards the sandbox's
  session/context — it stays a deliberate, user-consented action).
- Probes the playbook with `test -e "$HOME/.agentic-coding-playbook/AGENTS.md"`,
  which matches **both** the historical git-clone and the current tarball
  delivery.
- Writes `~/.acq-extra-kits` at **create** for every extra/CLI kit, so re-attach
  correctly sees them as already applied.

To pick up a refreshed built-in bundle on sbx 0.38 you must recreate the sandbox
(this discards its session/context):

```bash
acq rm <sandbox>
acq run opencode /path/to/your/project
```

**msb is unaffected** — it re-applies kits idempotently via `msb exec` and has no
`sbx kit add`. The upstream "not yet" in the sbx error suggests startup support in
the kit-add flow may return; if it does, in-place healing can be re-enabled. See
the update note in
[ADR-0009](adr/0009-require-sbx-0.35.0-in-place-kit-healing.md).

### Verifying the fix (live)

On a real sbx host (this cannot run inside a sandbox — no nested sandboxes), one
command reproduces the exact scenario and asserts all three fixes:

```bash
./scripts/verify-issue-320
```

It provisions a throwaway sandbox with a startup-bearing extra kit, re-attaches,
and checks that: the extra-kit marker was written at create; the re-attach heal
is a quiet no-op (no "missing the playbook kit", no extra-kit re-attempt, no
bogus "Recover with" hint); a forced mid-life re-add surfaces exactly one
recreate notice; and `acq kit update` fails fast (or short-circuits when already
current). The offline regression guard is in `test/bats/` (the sbx
heal-loop cases).

## 36. msb Create-Time Published Port Returns Empty Response for a Loopback-Only Guest Service

### Symptoms

On the **msb** backend, `acq ports <sandbox>` shows a create-time published port,
and the service answers from inside the sandbox:

```bash
$ acq ports paseo-test
sandbox 6767 -> host 127.0.0.1:6767 (create-time -p)

$ acq exec paseo-test -- curl http://127.0.0.1:6767/
<!doctype html>
...
```

But the same port fails from the host:

```bash
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:6767/
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
```

Chrome shows `(failed) net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE`. This is distinct from the older
ingress-deny failure (`ERR_CONNECTION_RESET`) in
[ADR-0019](adr/0019-msb-balanced-egress-is-egress-only.md): here the TCP connect
to the host listener succeeds, but the msb publisher cannot complete the
guest-side connection.

### Root Cause

The service is listening only on **guest loopback** (`127.0.0.1:GUEST`). For
example, `/proc/net/tcp` shows `0100007F:1A6F`, which is `127.0.0.1:6767`.

msb create-time publishing (`-p HOST:GUEST`, which acq emits from neutral
`publishedPorts`) binds a listener on the **host** loopback by default, but the
publisher connects to the sandbox's **guest network IP** for `GUEST`; it does not
dial guest `127.0.0.1`. A loopback-only service can therefore be healthy from
inside the sandbox while unreachable through create-time `-p` from the host.

### Fix

Bind the guest service to `0.0.0.0:GUEST` (or the guest interface address) when
you want it reachable through create-time `publishedPorts` / msb `-p`:

```bash
# Example shape; exact flag/env depends on the service
service --host 0.0.0.0 --port 6767
```

If the service must stay loopback-only, use acq's msb post-hoc publish path:

```bash
acq --backend msb ports <sandbox> --publish 16767:6767
curl http://127.0.0.1:16767/
```

That path uses `msb ssh serve` plus OpenSSH `-L`, so the connection originates
from inside the sandbox and can reach guest `127.0.0.1:6767`.

### Prevention / Status

- Documented in [BACKEND_GUIDE.md](BACKEND_GUIDE.md) under msb port limitations.
- When adding a kit that declares `publishedPorts`, make its supervised service
  listen on `0.0.0.0` unless it intentionally requires loopback-only access and
  documents the post-hoc `acq ports --publish` path.
- A quick discriminator is: if `acq exec <sandbox> -- curl http://127.0.0.1:GUEST`
  works but host curl returns `Empty reply from server`, inspect the guest
  listener bind address before chasing ingress policy or browser issues.

## 37. Commit signing fails in the sandbox: `user.signingKey needs to be set` / `No signature`

### Symptoms

Inside the sandbox, `git commit -S` (or any commit while `commit.gpgsign=true`)
fails or silently produces an unsigned commit:

```text
error: user.signingKey needs to be set for ssh signing
```

or the commit is created but `git cat-file commit HEAD | grep '^gpgsig'` finds
nothing, and `git log --show-signature` reports `No signature`. `ssh-add -l`
reports `Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.`

### Root Cause

The sandbox reaches the host SSH signing key over a **forwarded ssh-agent**, but
`SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is not exported into every shell/session by default. With no
agent reachable, git's SSH signer has no key and either errors or (depending on
config) writes an unsigned commit.

This is environmental, not a git misconfiguration: `user.signingkey`,
`gpg.format ssh`, and `commit.gpgsign true` can all be correct and signing still
fails purely because the agent socket isn't wired into the current shell.

### Fix

Export the forwarded agent socket for the commands that need to sign, then
commit/rebase as usual:

```bash
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/home/agent/.acq/ssh-agent.sock
ssh-add -l   # should now list the host signing key(s)

git commit -S ...        # or: git rebase <base>   (replayed commits are signed)
```

Verify the signature is embedded (this check needs no `allowed_signers` file):

```bash
git cat-file commit HEAD | grep -q '^gpgsig' && echo SIGNED || echo UNSIGNED
```

Notes:

- `git log --show-signature` may still print
  `gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile needs to be configured and exist` and show
  `No signature` even when the commit **is** signed — that is a local
  *verification* gap (no allowed-signers file), not a signing failure. GitHub
  verifies against its own registered-key store on push and will show
  **Verified**. Prefer the `git cat-file … | grep '^gpgsig'` check to confirm
  signing.
- `git rebase` re-signs each replayed commit automatically when the agent is
  reachable, so a rebase with `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` set does not need a separate
  `--amend -S` pass.

## 38. Spurious `M` (modified) diffs on scripts across the host/sandbox mount

### Symptoms

`git status` shows tracked files (commonly `acq`, `scripts/test-acq`,
`scripts/verify-backends`) as modified with no content change, and
`git diff` shows only mode lines:

```text
old mode 100755
new mode 100644
```

The noise breaks scripted branch work: a `git commit --amend` picks up the mode
churn, leaving the working tree "dirty," so a following `git switch <branch>`
aborts with *"Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by
checkout"* — and a loop that assumed the switch succeeded then operates on the
**wrong** branch.

### Root Cause

The repository is worked on across a host↔sandbox boundary (the sandbox worktree
lives under a mounted volume). The host (macOS) and the sandbox (Linux) disagree
on the executable bit, so git sees the `+x` bit flip back and forth as
`100755 ↔ 100644` filemode churn. It is not a real edit.

### Fix

Tell git to ignore the executable bit in **each** working tree (the setting is
per-working-tree, so setting it on the host does not cover the sandbox worktree
and vice versa):

```bash
git config core.fileMode false        # run in every clone/worktree of this repo
```

To make it the default for all future clones on a machine that routinely spans
this mount:

```bash
git config --global core.fileMode false
```

Workflow guard: when scripting branch operations, do **not** loop `git switch`
across a possibly-dirty tree. Run one branch per command, and guard switches
(`git switch "$b" || break`) so a failed checkout cannot silently leave you
amending the wrong branch.

## 39. Windows preview: `bash.exe` resolves to the WSL shim, WHP is not a feature flag, and the execution policy blocks scripts

### Symptoms

- On a Windows 11 host, `acq.cmd` / `acq.ps1` delegates into a WSL distro instead of Git Bash:
  `/bin/bash: /c/Users/.../acq: No such file or directory`.
- `install.ps1` aborts for a non-elevated user with
  `Get-WindowsOptionalFeature : The requested operation requires elevation.`
  instead of WHP guidance.
- `msb doctor` reports the host ready and sandboxes boot, yet
  `Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName HypervisorPlatform` reports `Disabled`.
- On a default Windows 11 client, `.\install.ps1` and the installed `acq`
  command fail with
  `... cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system`
  (`PSSecurityException`), while `irm ... | iex` works.

### Root Cause

- Git for Windows installs `Git\bin` but does **not** put it on `PATH` by default,
  so `Get-Command bash.exe` resolves to `C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe` — the WSL
  interop shim, not Git Bash.
- The WHP optional-feature *flag* is not the thing that makes WHP work. When the
  Windows hypervisor is already running (WSL2 / VirtualMachine Platform, VBS, or a
  virtualized guest), the user-mode WHP API (`WinHvPlatform.dll`, e.g.
  `WHvCreatePartition`) is callable regardless of the flag, which is also not
  readable without an elevated shell.
- Windows 11 **client** defaults its PowerShell execution policy to `Restricted`,
  which refuses to run script *files*. `powershell -File` is not exempt, so
  `acq.cmd` (which runs `acq.ps1`) and a direct `.\install.ps1` are blocked; the
  `irm ... | iex` path is unaffected because piped text is not a script file.

### Fix

- `acq.ps1` and `install.ps1` prefer known Git-for-Windows locations first and
  reject the WSL shim (`System32\bash.exe`, `SysWOW64\bash.exe`) when falling back
  to a PATH lookup.
- `install.ps1` probes WHP with `WHvCreatePartition` (the same call `msb` relies
  on) instead of gating on the feature flag; when the state stays undetermined it
  warns and defers to `msb doctor`, which `acq` surfaces before provisioning.
- Treat `msb doctor` as the authoritative readiness signal on Windows.
- The execution-policy requirement is documented (README "First-Run Snags",
  `docs/howto/acq.md`); allow local scripts with
  `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` or use the `irm | iex`
  one-liner. On a managed device the policy is set by Group Policy. `acq.cmd` and
  `install.ps1` deliberately do **not** pass `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`.

### Related Windows/MSYS notes

- Under Git Bash, the guest is a Linux microVM, so acq now computes two path
  forms (ADR-0029): `canonicalize_path` is the POSIX **guest** form and `host_path`
  the native **host** form (`cygpath -m` → `C:/...`). `msb` is invoked through a
  wrapper that sets `MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL='*'`, because MSYS otherwise rewrites
  POSIX-looking argv when launching the native `msb.exe` and corrupts
  colon-delimited mounts (`--volume /c/a:/c/a` → `C:\a;C:\a`) and guest-only
  values (`-w /home/agent` → `C:/Program Files/Git/home/agent`). The exclusion is
  scoped to `msb`; `git`/`ssh` keep the rewrite they rely on. An explicit
  `ACQ_MSB_WORKSPACE` override is canonicalized to the guest form too, so a
  drive-form value cannot leak into `-w`.
- Three `msb` call sites inline `MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL='*'` instead of using the
  wrapper: the two `exec msb exec …` lines (`exec` needs a binary, not a shell
  function) and the backgrounded `msb ssh serve …` in `_acq_msb_serve_start`.
  Wrapping the latter in the function would make `$!` a subshell rather than
  `msb`, so teardown/`acq rm` would kill the wrapper and orphan the listener
  with its loopback port still bound. See ADR-0029.
- The offline Bats suite is POSIX-oriented: on a Windows/MSYS host, `install.sh`
  tests (macOS/Linux installer), `chmod 0600` assertions (MSYS cannot represent
  them on NTFS — the Windows secret store no longer depends on them, since it
  encrypts at rest with DPAPI; see ADR-0028), and symlink-based tests cannot pass
  without native symlinks. None are regressions from the Windows preview path;
  validate that path with the checklist in `docs/howto/acq.md`.

## 40. AGENTS.md's "Durable References" Rule Was Unenforced (Deferred Cleanup)

### Symptoms

None at runtime — this is a documentation/process gap, not a bug. Recorded
here per AGENTS.md's own "Track Deferred Work" rule, which requires every
identified follow-up to be captured durably rather than left as an
unrecorded `TODO`.

### Root Cause

AGENTS.md's "Durable References" and "Fully Qualify Issue/PR References"
sections say code comments, docs, and ADR body prose must not rely on a
GitHub issue/PR reference to carry meaning, but nothing ever checked it.
`scripts/check-durable-references` (ADR-0030) now gates **new** additions in
CI and via a local pre-commit hook, but it is diff-scoped on purpose and does
not touch pre-existing content. As of this writing, the pre-existing backlog
includes bare/qualified issue references in prose bodies (outside an ADR's
own `## Links` section) in at least:

- `acq.backends/common.sh`, `acq.backends/kit-translate.sh`,
  `acq.backends/msb.sh`, `acq.backends/sbx.sh`, `acq.backends/secret-store.sh`,
  `acq.backends/progress.sh`, `acq`
- `docs/adr/0002-*.md`, `0005-*.md`, `0006-*.md`, `0007-*.md`, `0008-*.md`,
  `0009-*.md`, `0011-*.md`, `0014-*.md`, `0015-*.md`, `0020-*.md`,
  `0021-*.md`, `0023-*.md` (references in the body, not the Links section)
- `docs/KNOWN_FAILURE_MODES.md` (this file), `docs/explorations/acq-design.md`,
  `docs/explorations/acq-handoff-2.0.md`, `docs/howto/acq.md`,
  `docs/howto/sbx.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `scripts/verify-issue-320`
  (filename itself), `scripts/test-acq-lib.sh`, `scripts/verify-backends`

### Fix / Status

No mass cleanup is planned in the change that added this entry (ADR-0030) —
rewriting dozens of citations across the tree in one pass is a large,
separate effort with its own review risk, not a byproduct of adding the
check. The trigger to unblock this work: **the next time any of the files
above is touched for an unrelated reason, rewrite the tracker reference it
contains as prose (citing an ADR instead, where one exists) as part of that
change**, rather than leaving it for a dedicated cleanup PR that may never
get prioritized. `check-durable-references` will keep the fixed line from
regressing once it's touched.

### Remaining Work

- [ ] Opportunistic: reword each pre-existing reference above to prose (or an
      ADR cross-link) the next time its file is edited.
- [ ] Optional: once the backlog is small enough, switch
      `scripts/check-durable-references` from diff-scoped to whole-file
      scanning for full enforcement, and remove this entry.

When something fails, work through this list:

1. [ ] Is the secret actually in the container? (`echo $VAR_NAME`)
2. [ ] Is the endpoint URL exactly correct? (no typos, correct path)
3. [ ] Is the auth header format correct? (`Bearer` prefix)
4. [ ] Can the container reach the network? (`curl` test)
5. [ ] Is the config file actually being read? (add debug logging)
6. [ ] Did SBX CLI syntax change? (`sbx --help`)
7. [ ] Is this a known model/entitlement issue? (test with different model)
